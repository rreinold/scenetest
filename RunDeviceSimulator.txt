Here's what you need to do to run the scenetest device simulator.

build and run a clearblade instance

build scenetest -- make sure you do git pull on Go-SDK and scenetest

start the clearblade instance

The following is for a clearblade running on your local laptop:

    scenetest setup -info Novi.json -platform-url "http://127.0.0.1:9000" -messaging-url "127.0.0.1:1883" setup/novi.json

Then, do:

    scenetest run -info Novi.json  regression/deviceSimulator.json

Obviously, on the setup command, changes the url and ip address as necessary
