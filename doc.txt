Using scenetest

scenetest allows you to perform a system setup, run some tests, and tear things down. All of these steps are optional. Usually, I do a setup, and then run a bunch of tests. As usual, I always forget to tear things down.

examples/setup.json shows you how to set things up. Let's say you are using that amazon testing machine. 
To execute that file you do the following:

        ./scenetest -platform-url "http://ec2-54-157-191-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com" 
                        -messaging-url "ec2-54-157-191-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com:1883" -setup examples/setup.json

That command above will end up creating a file called TestSystemInfo.json, which has all the handy ids of those things
created during setup. Also, it creates a teardown file -- in this case it is called TestSystemTeardown.json.
Now, to run tests, do this (for example):

        ./scenetest -platform-url "http://ec2-54-157-191-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com" 
                -messaging-url "ec2-54-157-191-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com:1883" -info TestSystemInfo.json 
                -run examples/newTrigger.json

NOTE: the platform-url and the messaging-url flags are optional. The TestSystemInfo.json file
contains the appropriate values and uses those when these args are not passed in.

to tear them down, do:
        ./scenetest -platform-url "http://ec2-54-157-191-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com" 
                -messaging-url "ec2-54-157-191-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com:1883" -teardown TestSystemTeardown.json 

Obviously, use your favorite host -- you don't have to use the amazon testing box.

Best thing I can tell you to do is look at the examples. Good ones are pubsub.json newTrigger.json, etc.

Word of warning: if you subscribe to triggers (see newTrigger.json) be damned sure you make the correct number of
waitTrigger calls, or else you'll kill the server. Comforting.

If you need to create new statements (and you will), have a looksee at mqttlib.go (publish and subscribe) and data.go 
(createItem). codelib.go has the "call" statement which invokes a code service


Random note about triggers. If you want to be notified when a trigger runs, you have to do several things.

    1. Your service should depend on library triggerLib.js found in the js subdir.
    2. Your service should call the publishTrigger() method in that library. For an
       example, see itemCreatedTrigger.js
    3. Your execution json file should contain a call ["subscribeTriggers"]
    4. Finally (important) execute one ["waitTrigger", ...] call for each trigger generated.
       see ./examples/newTrigger.json for an example of how to do this. Note the number of calls (30)
       to wait trigger per createItem. That's cuz we're running 30 instances of the same scenario in
       parallel.
